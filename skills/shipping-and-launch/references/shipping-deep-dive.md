# Shipping and Launch — Deep Dive

On-demand companion to the shipping-and-launch `SKILL.md` — rationale, code samples, and anti-patterns that support the Worker Execution Contract.

## When to Use

- Deploying a feature to production for the first time
- Releasing a significant change to users
- Migrating data or infrastructure
- Opening a beta or early access program
- Any deployment that carries risk (all of them)

## Feature Flag Check (code sample)

```typescript
// Feature flag check
const flags = await getFeatureFlags(userId);

if (flags.taskSharing) {
  // New feature: task sharing
  return <TaskSharingPanel task={task} />;
}

// Default: existing behavior
return null;
```

## Error Reporting (code samples)

```typescript
// Set up error boundary with reporting
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error: Error, info: React.ErrorInfo) {
    // Report to error tracking service
    reportError(error, {
      componentStack: info.componentStack,
      userId: getCurrentUser()?.id,
      page: window.location.pathname,
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <ErrorFallback onRetry={() => this.setState({ hasError: false })} />;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// Server-side error reporting
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  reportError(err, {
    method: req.method,
    url: req.url,
    userId: req.user?.id,
  });

  // Don't expose internals to users
  res.status(500).json({
    error: { code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR', message: 'Something went wrong' },
  });
});
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It works in staging, it'll work in production" | Production has different data, traffic patterns, and edge cases. Monitor after deploy. |
| "We don't need feature flags for this" | Every feature benefits from a kill switch. Even "simple" changes can break things. |
| "Monitoring is overhead" | Not having monitoring means you discover problems from user complaints instead of dashboards. |
| "We'll add monitoring later" | Add it before launch. You can't debug what you can't see. |
| "Rolling back is admitting failure" | Rolling back is responsible engineering. Shipping a broken feature is the failure. |

## Red Flags

- Deploying without a rollback plan
- No monitoring or error reporting in production
- Big-bang releases (everything at once, no staging)
- Feature flags with no expiration or owner
- No one monitoring the deploy for the first hour
- Production environment configuration done by memory, not code
- "It's Friday afternoon, let's ship it"
